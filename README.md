# My Library App (Version 1)

This is the first version of the My Library app, a simple web application for managing your book library. With this app, you can keep track of your favorite books, including details like the author, title, number of pages, and whether you have read them or not.

## Features

- Add new books to your library by filling out a form.
- Display all the books in your library with their respective details.
- Mark books as read or unread using a checkbox.
- Remove books from your library with the click of a button.

## Future Updates

In future versions of the app, I plan to implement the following features and enhancements:

- Responsiveness: Make the app mobile-friendly and adaptable to different screen sizes.
- Form Validation: Implement client-side form validation to ensure accurate and complete book entries.
- Local Storage: Save the library data locally so that it persists between page reloads.
- Book Images: Allow users to add book cover images to enhance visual representation.
- Additional Features: Explore more features like sorting, searching, and filtering books.

Stay tuned for updates as I continue to improve the My Library app and provide a better book management experience!
